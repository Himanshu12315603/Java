1. Introduction:-

Defination1:- Any service requirment specification(SRS) is considered as an Interface.

Eg1. JDBC API access requirment specification to develop Database Driver.

---> Database vendor is responsible to impliment JDBC API.
      

                        SUN 
                        |
                        |
                      JDBC API
                  /        |       \
                 /         |  ----- \
                /          |         \
        Oracle Driver   Mysql Driver    DB2 Driver


Eg2. Servlet API access requirment specification to develop web Server.

---> Web server vendor is responsible to impliment servlet API.


                        SUN 
                        |
                        |
                   Servlet API
                  /        |       \
                 /         |------- \
                /          |         \
    Apache Tom Cat    Oracle Web logic   IBM web sphere
        Server          Server                Server



Defination2:- From client point of view and Interface defines the set of services what he is expecting.
          
            From Service provider point of view an interface defines the set of services what he is offering
Hence Any contract between client and service provider is considered as an interface.


Eg. Through Bank ATM GUI Screen, Bank people are highlighting the set of Services what they are offering at the 
same time the same GUI Screen represents the set of services what customer is expecting. Hence this GUI Screen 
Access contract between customer and bank people.

                      
                      withdraw 
 customer             Mini Statement                    Bank people 
                      Balance Enquiry 

                            
                    Bank GUI ATM Screen 



              
Defination3:- Inside interface every method is always abstract whether we are declaring or not. Hence Interface
      is considered as 100% Pure abstract class.


Summery Defination:- Any Service requirment specification or any contract between client and service provider or 
100% pure abstract class is nothing but interface.
