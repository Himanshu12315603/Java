@Conditional Operator(? :):- The only possible ternary operator in java
			is conditional operator.



Syntax:-   	int x = (10 < 20) ? 30 : 40;
		System.out.println(x);		//30


We can perform nesting of Conditional operator also:-

	int x = (10>20) ? 30 : ((40>50) ? 60 : 70);

	System.out.println(x);		// 70

@new Operator:-


We can use new Operator to create object.


Eg.  Test t = new Test();


Note:- i). After creating an object Constructor will be executed to perform
	initilization of an object, Hence Constructer is not for Creating
	of object and It is for initilization of an object.


	ii). In java we have only new keyword but not delete keyword because 
	distraction of useless object is the responsibility of garbage collecter.

@[] Operator:- We can use this operator to declare and create Arrays.

Eg. int[] x = new int[10];
